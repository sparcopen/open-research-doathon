# In brief

| What is this about? | Getting started |
| --- | --- |
| We invite you, whether you're in London or afar, to a weekend of learning, making, and doing on March 4-5 to advance [Open Research Data](https://sparcopen.org/open-data/).   | If you like what you see here, please register for the event as an on-site or virtual participant by going to its [EventBrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-research-data-do-a-thon-in-london-virtual-tickets-31417371203).  |

# Background

[Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) is an annual international celebration of [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data). In 2017, it takes place on March 4, and on that occasion, [lots of events](http://opendataday.org/#map) are taking place around the world, focusing on specific kinds or aspects of open data. 

Here is an introductory video about Open Data Day:
[![Open Data Day introductory video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/w32jJvbewkk/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w32jJvbewkk)


# Specifics

|  Aim: hands-on with research data | Here is the plan |
| --- | --- |
|  [![Sandbox](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Sandbox_with_interactive_projection_at_31c3.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASandbox_with_interactive_projection_at_31c3.jpg) | As part of the celebrations for Open Data Day 2017, a two-day do-a-thon all around [open research data](https://sparcopen.org/open-data/) will be organized [in London](https://www.nwspk.com/) and online on March 4-5. The event is hosted by [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/) and the [NIH](https://nih.gov/). This repo helps coordinate activities around that, and we will update it on a regular basis until and during the event and perhaps thereafter. <br><br> At its heart, Open Research Data is about making it easy for you and others to see, use and share data pertaining to past, ongoing or possibly even future research. This simple idea is powering some of the largest [breakthroughs](https://sparcopen.org/impact-story/human-genome-project/) of our time, and our event aims to celebrate and accelerate the power of Open Research Data. <br><br>  We invite you, whether new or old to Open Research Data, scholar or citizen, to join us for this weekend to make, hack, contribute, try, teach, design, test, learn (or just about anything!) in the name of Open Research Data. <br><br> In London, we'll provide fast wifi, power (both for your laptops and your bodies) and a program that will spark ideas and collaborations for the weekend. <br><br> If you can't make it to London, join us online from wherever you are.  |

# How it works

We'll be using this GitHub repository for documenting and discussing ideas before, during, and after the event, both for remote participants and everyone else who is interested. We also have [a Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gTdPPr0ZMCKv5X-_XL9au6buwV6Fz194djjw3YXSFvs/edit#) to take notes collaboratively.  As a remote participant, expect to be able to pitch and discuss your ideas for the weekend with all attendees. We'll be using [light orange](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Avirtual%20-label%3Ameta) labels for issues specific to remote attendance, and [light purple](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Aon-site%20-label%3Ameta) for on-site issues. Note that people in the room are welcome to use the online features as well.

Check out the [yellow labels](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aidea%20-label%3Ameta) for hacky ideas to work on! Feel free to propose your own, even multiple ones: having more ideas may make it easier to find people to team up with. Conversely, feel free to have a go at any of these ideas, and let us &mdash; and their proposers &mdash; know how far you've come. There are [purple](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainterests%20-label%3Ameta) labels for attendees to say what their interests and skills are, which is especially useful if they are not yet involved with one of the proposed ideas.
To present the ideas and to inform about other topics of interest, we'll be having lightning talks, which can be tracked via the [red](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Alightning-talks%20-label%3Ameta) labels.

There are also [light green](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ameta) labels that we're using to organize the event. Your participation is welcome here too.

For guidelines on how to contribute to this project, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Program

Each day will run 9am - 6pm. We'll provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks (including coffee, of course) with informal dinner & drinks each evening. The program is designed to be lightweight and flexible to allow the maximum time for doing.

Virtual participants are encouraged to peak in on our activities any time, but we recommend defaulting to something like 9am - 6pm in their respective time zones.
