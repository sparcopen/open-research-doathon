## Event page & ticketing

We used a (simple event page)[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-research-data-do-a-thon-in-london-virtual-tickets-31417371203#] with a few key components:  

* A description of the do-a-thon concept, what can be done, and who should come

> We invite you, whether new or old to Open Research Data, scholar or citizen, in London or across the globe, to join us for this weekend to make, hack, contribute, try, teach, design, test, learn (or just about anything!) in the name of Open Research Data.

* A prominent invitation to remote participants, with what to expect.

> If you can’t make it to London, join us online from wherever you are. We’ll be documenting and discussing ideas before, during, and after the event for remote participants. As a remote participant, expect to be able to pitch and discuss your ideas for the weekend with all attendees!

* A nominal, refunded ticket fee

This helped us as organizers know who was actually coming. With a ticket cost, the drop of rate from RSVP to attendance is over 50% (and another 50% between days). With a ticket cost, that is more like 20%. Our cost covered most of the actual food cost their attendance would entail - this way if they didn't show up we didn't lose money. We were flexible with refunds, and waived the cost if needed. Many participants offered their ticket cost as a donation when we actually came to collect it.

## Budget

## Venue hunting

You need an event with:
* lots of plugs
* good wifi
* a projector / mic
* a decent space for groups to work (ideally one room)

## Food

For an event running 9am to 6pm we provided breakfast, lunch & snacks. To keep costs down, and our organizing nimble we simply brought food from local supermarkets & restaurants. We tried to cover obvious food needs (vegetarian, vegan) and let other food requirements to address "on the day".

## Getting folks to attend

Many other resources on the internet speak at length about this - get searching!

To encourage diversity at your event, especially regarding gender balance of your participants we'd suggest reaching out to local groups focusing on addressing gender gaps at events (Women on "X" style groups). We'd also suggest stating explicitly in your event page that you encourage attendance from often marginalised groups.

## Programming

Read this doc, decide what you do / don't want to use, then go for it!
