Instructions for posting issues: 
(1) Write your post (below this text blob) using Markdown (as per https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ ) or just plain text.
(2) Add the appropriate labels to your post, e.g. 'idea' or 'lightning talk' (or both for idea pitches), 'interests', 'skills' or 'experience'. Use 'help wanted' as needed.
(3) Don't worry about these introductory lines - you can leave or delete them, as they won't display anyway (you can check this via Preview).
(4) Hit the 'Submit new issue' button.
